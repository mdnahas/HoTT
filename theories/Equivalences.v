(** Homotopy equivalences are a central concept in homotopy type theory. Before we define equivalences, let us consider when two types [A] and [B] should be considered "the same".

   The first option is to require existence of [f : A -> B] and [g : B -> A] which are inverses of each other, up to homotopy.  Homotopically speaking, we should also require a certain condition on these homotopies, which is one of the triangle identities for adjunctions in category theory.  Thus, we call this notion an *adjoint equivalence*.

  The other triangle identity is provable from the first one, along with all the higher coherences, so it is reasonable to only assume one of them.  Moreover, as we will see, if we have maps which are inverses up to homotopy, it is always possible to make the triangle identity hold by modifying one of the homotopies.

   The second option is to use Vladimir Voevodsky's definition of an equivalence as a map whose homotopy fibers are contractible.  We call this notion a *homotopy bijection*.

   An interesting third option was suggested by AndrÃ© Joyal: a map [f] which has separate left and right homotopy inverses.  We call this notion a *homotopy isomorphism*.

   While the second option was the one used originally, and it is the most concise one, it makes more sense to use the first one in a formalized development, since it exposes most directly equivalence as a structure.  In particular, it is easier to extract directly from it the data of a homotopy inverse to [f], which is what we care about having most in practice.  Thus, adjoint equivalences are what we will refer to merely as *equivalences*. *)

(** Naming convention: we use [equiv] and [Equiv] systematically to denote types of equivalences, and [isequiv] and [IsEquiv] systematically to denote the assertion that a given map is an equivalence. *)

(** The fact that [r] is a left inverse of [s]. It is called [cancel] in ssreflect.  As a mnemonic, note that the partially applied type [Sect s] is the type of proofs that [s] is a section. *)

(** A notation for the inverse of an equivalence.  We can apply this to a function as long as there is a typeclass instance asserting it to be an equivalence.  We can also apply it to an element of [A <~> B], since there is an implicit coercion to [A -> B] and also an existing instance of [IsEquiv]. *)

(** We now give many ways to construct equivalences.  In each case, we define an instance of the typeclass [IsEquiv] named [isequiv_X], followed by an element of the record type [Equiv] named [equiv_X].

   Whenever we need to assume, as a hypothesis, that a certain function is an equivalence, we do it by assuming separately a function and a proof of [IsEquiv].  This is more general than assuming an inhabitant of [Equiv], since the latter has an implicit coercion and an existing instance to give us the former automatically.  Moreover, implicit generalization makes it easy to assume a function and a proof of [IsEquiv]. *)

(** In all the above cases, we were able to directly construct all the structure of an equivalence.  However, as is evident, sometimes it is quite difficult to prove the adjoint law.

   The following adjointification theorem allows us to be lazy about this if we wish.  It says that if we have all the data of an (adjoint) equivalence except the triangle identity, then we can always obtain the triangle identity by modifying the datum [equiv_is_section] (or [equiv_is_retraction]).  The proof is the same as the standard categorical argument that any equivalence can be improved to an adjoint equivalence.

   As a stylistic matter, we try to avoid using adjointification in the library whenever possible, to preserve the homotopies specified by the user.  *)

A map with both a section and a retraction is called a "homotopy isomorphism".
